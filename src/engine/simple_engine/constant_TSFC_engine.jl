    constant_TSFC_engine!(ac, d1, imission::Int64, ip::Int64, d2, d3)

A very simple model of an aircraft engine consuming some fuel. The fuel flow is determined by the thrust required 
by the aircraft. The thrust is calculated based on the climb rate of the aircraft. The fuel flow is calculated using 
the thrust specific fuel consumption (TSFC) of the engine, which is an input.

!!! details "ðŸ”ƒ Inputs and Outputs"
    **Input:**
    - `ac::aircraft`: aircraft object
    - `imission::Int64`: mission index
    - `ip::Int64`: mission point index
    - `d`s: dummy variables used for compatibility with other sizing functions

    **Output:**
    No direct outputs. The `ac` object gets modified with the engine parameters.
